                <p>
                    This was a fantastic course for me, as it really introduced
                     me to fine arts at the collegiate level and re-ignited my
                     passion for creating. Taking this course solidified in me
                     how much I love to create art and re-directed my post graduation
                     plans to be more visual/design oriented. I've included two of my favorite
                     projects from the course.

                <h5>Spring 2021</h5>
                <p>
                    This class really pushed my artistic abilities since it was in completely new
                     mediums - wood, metal, and plaster. We worked on a couple different large
                     scale projects, and I learned skills in table saws, casting, and welding.
                     Included is a detail shot from my final project.

                <h4>Design Foundations</h4>
                <h5>Summer 2021</h5>
                <p>
                    Taking this class was a great experience for me since I've decided to take my
                     post-graduation plans in a more visual, front-end development direction.
                     This class gave me the foundations of how to format visuals and the
                     vocabulary with which to talk about my designs. I think I gained some very
                     important skills from this course that will directly transfer over into a
                     front-end development role. I also realized that I do have some affinity for
                     design.

                        The goal of this project was to capture 3 photos that could be used for
                         the cover of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/12/02/magazine/tree-communication-mycorrhiza.html">this</a>

                         I chose to design modular a fruit bowl.

                <p>
                    I was so excited to take this class and felt so lucky to be able to get a spot.
                     I'd been trying to get in my whole time here at UW. 3D4M is definitely a love
                     of mine and taking the other design and sculpture classes I have here has
                     continued to develop my passion. Ceramics though is certainly my favorite,
                     and I was very happy to finally learn the wheel, though it took far more
                     practice than I expected. I've included a photo of my final project.
