                <p>
                    Upon completion of this course, I realized that I got a lot more out of it than
                     I was expecting. Initially I anticipated that I would have more confidence and
                     a better understanding of my place in the world, as well as an understanding of
                     how I can use that to help others. Looking back on it now, I can see that I've
                     changed in more ways than just these. I can see from the way that I interact
                     with people and the opportunities that I am considering that I have grown a lot
                     in my confidence in myself and my abilities. Not only this, but working in a
                     smaller class more closely with my instructors has made me much more confident
                     in talking to faculty, which will benefit my education in many ways, from
                     office hours to research positions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also learned a lot about myself on this trip, and expanded on things I already
                     knew. Being abroad has most definitely given me a different perspective on how
                     I see myself and the world around me. I've found that I have a lot more empathy
                     and patience for helping people in everyday situations, because I have now
                     experienced being at a loss in a new environment. I also am much more aware of
                     the privilege that I have, and how I might be able to appropriately use that to
                     help those less fortunate than me. I also found that I'm much more interested
                     in the humanities and social justice topics than I originally thought. Coming
                     into college I knew I wanted to be a CS major and I've focused my efforts
                     primarily in STEM. However, after taking a few honors courses and going on
                     this trip in particular, I've realized I have a strong passion for social
                     justice and really enjoy discussing the intricacies of social issues and how
                     to solve them. Having the one-on-one discussions with my supervisor really
                     helped to solidify these realizations for me. Talking to Tory aided in
                     directing me to the conclusion that I do have a strong interest in the social
                     sciences and that I can and should pursue this interest along with my CS degree.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This experience has made me tremendously excited to continue my current honors
                     course, Science and Engineering for Social Justice, because it's exactly the
                     topic I'm focused on right now. I want to find an intersection between computer
                     science and the social sciences where I can make a positive impact on people,
                     and so far it seems this class is discussing just that. I hope at the end of
                     this quarter I'll have the tools to find the direction that I want to take my
                     major in after I graduate. For future coursework I've been inspired to pursue
                     more humanities courses, and hopefully find an application of CS through them
                     that I'm passionate about. In addition to taking more social science classes,
                     I want to get involved in activities outside of the classroom that promote
                     social justice and use my skills. Looking forward to the career fairs coming
                     up, I am definitely more focused on internships at companies that are trying
                     to make a positive impact in the world. I'm also looking into different clubs
                     at UW that do the same, like Husky ADAPT.

                    Over the course of the last quarter I learned about the importance of educating
                     and having an awareness of your privilege. This class demonstrated to me how
                     important education can be to your position in the world and also your view of
                     the world. It has also shown me that the way the educational institutions are
                     set up, and the way a culture classifies someone, can have a great impact on
                     where they go in life. I also gained a better awareness of where my place is
                     in the world and how I can use that appropriately to help others. Talking about
                     different social injustices in class, such as the refugee crisis in Italy, and
                     then being faced with it really solidified for me how important it is that
                     those of us with the opportunity should try and rectify the situation. I
                     strongly feel that this program stirred a necessary passion in me for social
                     justice, and has completely changed the way I see myself and the world around
                     me for the better.

                <h3>Leadership:</h3>
                <h3>Teaching Assistant for Direct Admit Seminar</h3>
                <h5>Autumn 2020</h5>
                <p>
                    Working as a TA this quarter has been a great experience in many ways.
                     Particularly because classes are online I've appreciated the opportunity it's
                     given me to feel more connected to campus and UW, as well as meet new people.
                     This has also given me a chance to develop my leadership and presentation
                     skills. I not only feel much more confident in my public speaking, but also
                     in my ability to answer students questions and hold an authority position
                     academically. During my time here at UW I haven't had very many leadership
                     roles, I've mostly been focused on completing my course work which doesn't
                     normally require that. I think this experience working as a TA was important
                     for me to develop those leadership skills and that confidence, which is
                     something I don't necessarily get to do in my courses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm very grateful for this exposure to teaching, as its something I've enjoyed
                     previously, and it's encouraged me and reaffirmed for me that this is a path I
                     should explore more for my future. For me, being a TA for this seminar was less
                     daunting than being a TA for another CSE class, and now that I have this
                     experience under my belt I've felt confident enough in myself to apply for a TA
                     position for the CSE 14X series. This is something I've wanted to do since my
                     first quarter here at UW, so it's exciting that I've finally felt ready to take this on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, I enjoyed being able to help my students in more ways than just
                     academically, also providing advice on other aspects of life. I've realized
                     talking with my students how important the DA seminar can be for some people
                     in terms of setting up and facilitating a space to make connections with their
                     peers, something especially important during online classes. Something that
                     I've learned about myself is that I really like to help people, it makes my
                     day feel like it had purpose and I feel much more connected to the world and
                     fulfilled. This is something that's been highlighted by this experience, and
                     moving forward I want to incorporate this into my career plans.

                    The specific section that I taught was focused on social good in CS, and I had
                     an excellent time discussing this with my students. During my time here at UW
                     I've become increasingly passionate about the intersection between social good
                     and CS, so I'm very grateful that I had the opportunity to share that with
                     others. I'm also really glad that at the end of the course some of my students
                     expressed their own interest now in using CS for social good. It feels
                     empowering for me that I might be able to empower other people to use their
                     skills for change.
