                <p>
                    Upon completion of this course, I realized that I got a lot more out of it than
                     I was expecting. Initially I anticipated that I would have more confidence and
                     a better understanding of my place in the world, as well as an understanding of
                     how I can use that to help others. Looking back on it now, I can see that I've
                     changed in more ways than just these. I can see from the way that I interact
                     with people and the opportunities that I am considering that I have grown a lot
                     in my confidence in myself and my abilities. Not only this, but working in a
                     smaller class more closely with my instructors has made me much more confident
                     in talking to faculty, which will benefit my education in many ways, from
                     office hours to research positions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also learned a lot about myself on this trip, and expanded on things I already
                     knew. Being abroad has most definitely given me a different perspective on how
                     I see myself and the world around me. I've found that I have a lot more empathy
                     and patience for helping people in everyday situations, because I have now
                     experienced being at a loss in a new environment. I also am much more aware of
                     the privilege that I have, and how I might be able to appropriately use that to
                     help those less fortunate than me. I also found that I'm much more interested
                     in the humanities and social justice topics than I originally thought. Coming
                     into college I knew I wanted to be a CS major and I've focused my efforts
                     primarily in STEM. However, after taking a few honors courses and going on
                     this trip in particular, I've realized I have a strong passion for social
                     justice and really enjoy discussing the intricacies of social issues and how
                     to solve them. Having the one-on-one discussions with my supervisor really
                     helped to solidify these realizations for me. Talking to Tory aided in
                     directing me to the conclusion that I do have a strong interest in the social
                     sciences and that I can and should pursue this interest along with my CS degree.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This experience has made me tremendously excited to continue my current honors
                     course, Science and Engineering for Social Justice, because it's exactly the
                     topic I'm focused on right now. I want to find an intersection between computer
                     science and the social sciences where I can make a positive impact on people,
                     and so far it seems this class is discussing just that. I hope at the end of
                     this quarter I'll have the tools to find the direction that I want to take my
                     major in after I graduate. For future coursework I've been inspired to pursue
                     more humanities courses, and hopefully find an application of CS through them
                     that I'm passionate about. In addition to taking more social science classes,
                     I want to get involved in activities outside of the classroom that promote
                     social justice and use my skills. Looking forward to the career fairs coming
                     up, I am definitely more focused on internships at companies that are trying
                     to make a positive impact in the world. I'm also looking into different clubs
                     at UW that do the same, like Husky ADAPT.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over the course of the last quarter I learned about the importance of educating
                     and having an awareness of your privilege. This class demonstrated to me how
                     important education can be to your position in the world and also your view of
                     the world. It has also shown me that the way the educational institutions are
                     set up, and the way a culture classifies someone, can have a great impact on
                     where they go in life. I also gained a better awareness of where my place is
                     in the world and how I can use that appropriately to help others. Talking about
                     different social injustices in class, such as the refugee crisis in Italy, and
                     then being faced with it really solidified for me how important it is that
                     those of us with the opportunity should try and rectify the situation. I
                     strongly feel that this program stirred a necessary passion in me for social
                     justice, and has completely changed the way I see myself and the world around
                     me for the better.

                    <p>I will be participating in the Education Rome: Gender & Multiculturalism
                         study abroad trip. The primary focus of this trip is to develop an
                         understanding of gendered topics and how prominent Western cultures from
                         the past have shaped how we view femininity and masculinity now. The trip
                         also explores how these accepted social concepts impact the oppression of
                         people based on both gender and race. I intend to be participating in the
                         coursework and course discussions and activities. My expectations for my

                        I will be traveling to Rome, Italy for three weeks to participate in this
                         course. This will involve extensive time spent outside of the U.S., and
                         extensive engagement with the culture in Italy. I will be participating in
                         course work that focuses on how ancient Rome's culture has shaped Italian
                         and US cultures, and this will include several trips to physical sites in
                         Rome.

                    <p>
                        I chose this program specifically because there are a lot of disparities
                         between the way men and women are treated, and I think that analyzing the
                         way that these ideas started can help in figuring out a way to ultimately
                         equalize it. I am hoping that from taking this course I will have a better
                         understanding of the world around me, both from what I learned in the
                         course and what I learned from spending significant time in a different
                         culture. I am hoping that the knowledge and experience I gain from this
                         program will help me to become a more conscious global citizen, and help
                         me to see where there are places that I can act to improve the world
                         around me.

                    <p>
                        This activity connects to my past honors course Honors 211, and my past
                         composition course, ENGL 182. In my honors course we discussed how
                         different cultural values can manifest in how their language is structured
                         and what phrases they use. This connects to this activity because it also
                         focuses on analyzing the differences between cultures and their values,
                         and how that manifests. In my composition class we had discussions on
                         racial differences in how people are treated in US culture, which is
                         something that this activity will also look at. This activity speaks to
                         my broader education goals because I think that it will counter-balance
                         my STEM heavy course load, and I hope that it will help me become a more
                         conscious citizen in the world.

                        The goal of my program and the people that I am working with is to look
                         critically at social constructs both in Italy and in the US, find the reasons
                         for social inequality, and possibly find opportunities for social change.
                         I will contribute to this goal by being an active participant in the

                <h3>Teaching Assistant for Direct Admit Seminar</h3>
                <h5>Autumn 2020</h5>
                <p>
                    Working as a TA this quarter has been a great experience in many ways.
                     Particularly because classes are online I've appreciated the opportunity it's
                     given me to feel more connected to campus and UW, as well as meet new people.
                     This has also given me a chance to develop my leadership and presentation
                     skills. I not only feel much more confident in my public speaking, but also
                     in my ability to answer students questions and hold an authority position
                     academically. During my time here at UW I haven't had very many leadership
                     roles, I've mostly been focused on completing my course work which doesn't
                     normally require that. I think this experience working as a TA was important
                     for me to develop those leadership skills and that confidence, which is
                     something I don't necessarily get to do in my courses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm very grateful for this exposure to teaching, as its something I've enjoyed
                     previously, and it's encouraged me and reaffirmed for me that this is a path I
                     should explore more for my future. For me, being a TA for this seminar was less
                     daunting than being a TA for another CSE class, and now that I have this
                     experience under my belt I've felt confident enough in myself to apply for a TA
                     position for the CSE 14X series. This is something I've wanted to do since my
                     first quarter here at UW, so it's exciting that I've finally felt ready to take this on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, I enjoyed being able to help my students in more ways than just
                     academically, also providing advice on other aspects of life. I've realized
                     talking with my students how important the DA seminar can be for some people
                     in terms of setting up and facilitating a space to make connections with their
                     peers, something especially important during online classes. Something that
                     I've learned about myself is that I really like to help people, it makes my
                     day feel like it had purpose and I feel much more connected to the world and
                     fulfilled. This is something that's been highlighted by this experience, and
                     moving forward I want to incorporate this into my career plans.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The specific section that I taught was focused on social good in CS, and I had
                     an excellent time discussing this with my students. During my time here at UW
                     I've become increasingly passionate about the intersection between social good
                     and CS, so I'm very grateful that I had the opportunity to share that with
                     others. I'm also really glad that at the end of the course some of my students
                     expressed their own interest now in using CS for social good. It feels
                     empowering for me that I might be able to empower other people to use their
                     skills for change.

                        Throughout my time here at UW I've realized more and more how important
                         leveraging my skills for social good is to me. Since my specific section
                         is focused on social good, I'm looking forward to using my position as a
                         TA to educate the incoming students on the importance of using their skills
                         for good, and show them that CS as a major has very broad and powerful
                         applications in many fields. As a TA I'll have the opportunity to do this
                         weekly throughout the quarter, and I'll have the chance to compose my own
                         lesson plans that will encapsulate the importance of social good in CS and
                         communicate that, hopefully inspiring the students use their skills for
                         positive change. I also have the opportunity to collaborate on this with
                         my partner TA.

                        I wanted to work as a TA because I've wanted to be more involved in and give
                         back to the UW community, and I wanted to be able to let others learn from
                         my experiences and feel welcome at the Allen School. I'm hoping to gain
                         confidence in my presentation skills, develop my leadership, and learn more
                         about what goes into teaching. I also hope to make a connection with some
                         of my students and really support them during this transition into college.
                         I'm looking forward to applying the experiences I have in this position to
                         hopefully work as a TA for other courses, and gain soft skills that I'll
                         use in many other applications.

                        Since my section is focused on social good, it ties in closely with an
                         honors course I took last year, Science and Engineering for Social
                         Justice. This course inspired me to use my STEM skills to help as many
                         people as possible and make a positive change in the world, so I'm hoping
                         to impart some of my knowledge from that class and some of that inspiration
                         onto my students. More broadly this experience is a way for me to start
                         helping people and making a positive impact which is one of my biggest
                         goals, and along with this I'm developing my leadership skills. It's also
                         a chance for me to explore teaching which is something I have considered
                         doing after graduation.

                        A big goal of the Allen School is to create a welcoming environment and a
                         community, and I think that as a TA for the direct admit seminar I'm able
                         to contribute to this in the way that I teach my students. In my section
                         I'm encouraging students to make connections with each other and ask
                         questions of myself and my partner TA. I'm also emphasizing social good
                         through CS and I believe that's something that not every freshman is
                         immediately thinking about, but still is something very important for our
                         communities.
