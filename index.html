                    Throughout my time at UW, I haven't always felt like I've had a direction. In
                     fact most of my time here has been spent finding my direction. I've gone down
                     many different paths and explored many different things, and what I realize
                     now is that all those paths were heading in the same direction even if it
                     didn't seem so at the time. As the phrase goes, “all roads lead to Rome”.

                    I started out in computer science thinking I wanted to do something science
                     focused, perhaps research or a medical application. I truly felt that for me
                     to find a place in the world and find happiness I needed to be doing something
                     “important”, which at the time meant ignoring my creative side. I was more
                     focused on having a successful life, as defined by external things and society,
                     rather than a fulfilled life which is defined by my internal happiness.

                    For the first couple years I just took my required courses and planned for a
                     Neural Computation and Engineering minor, and I did very little exploration
                     outside of my study abroad. As I was finishing out my sophomore year the
                     pandemic started, and this acted as catalyst - bringing to the surface doubts
                     I had about my major and direction, as well as giving me the opportunity I
                     needed to explore other interests. The pandemic disrupted life, there was no
                     longer a set schedule I was supposed to achieve and external expectations
                     disappeared. It forced me to re-evaluate what I was doing and refocus, it
                     forced me to prioritize my internal happiness.

                    During my junior year I had a major turning point in both my personal life and
                     academic life. I happened to enroll in a fine arts honors course and I realized
                     that I have a very strong passion for the arts that I had been ignoring. This
                     combined with falling into deep depression made me start to prioritize the
                     things that gave me fulfillment and happiness, it became a matter of necessity.
                     This meant I gave up my minor to pursue more art and design classes. During
                     this time I was also struggling with my desire to remain in CS, since it
                     felt so restricted to the backend. It wasn't until I took a web programming
                     class that I realized front-end development was the place for me, it offered
                     a marriage between my interest in the visual arts and my aptitude for programming.

                    All of my experiences here at UW were parts of the whole, and worked together
                     to bring me to the point that I'm at now; I traveled across Europe my freshman
                     year, and I worked my way through intense CS courses. I sweated through career
                     fairs my sophomore year, and I left my internship feeling more lost than before.
                     I took care of myself by leaning into the arts my junior year, and I explored
                     front-end development. I dragged myself out of depression my senior year, and
                     I found a direction. Every endeavor and the things that I've learned along the
                     way have eventually led me to the same place. I'm very happy to say that I'm
                     now graduating with a direction, and a direction that I'm passionate about.
