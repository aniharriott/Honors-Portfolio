                <p>
                  Creating my four year course plan, though it was tentative,
                   really got me to think more clearly about what I want to do
                   in life and how I am going to get there. I found by doing my
                   plan that I have more flexibility in my timeline than I
                   originally thought, meaning that I have time to pursue things
                   like research, study abroad, or potentially a minor. I started
                   to explore these options and found that the things I was getting most
                   excited about were the neural applications of computer science, such as
                   research at the Integrated Brain Imaging Center and the Neural
                   Computation and Engineering minor.  The application of my CS degree in a
                   career was always something that I was unsure about, but now I think that
                   I have at least found a starting point for another passion that can direct
                   my career. Hopefully within the next year I will be able to try out some of
                   the classes in the NCE minor and decide if that is something I want to
                   continue to pursue.

                <h3>HONORS 392</h3>
                <h4>Science and Engineering for Social Justice</h4>
                <h5>Autumn 2019</h5>
                <p>
                  Going into this past quarter I was the least excited about my honors class. I had
                   only signed up for it because there was space in it and it fit my schedule.
                   However, this turned out to be one of my favorite classes this quarter.
                   The topic of the class, Science and Engineering for Social Justice, is exactly
                   what I was interested after my time in Rome learning about the European Refugee
                   Crisis. After the summer I felt inspired to use my life to make more of a
                   difference, but was at a loss for how with a STEM degree. This honors class
                   helped inspire me and reinvigorated my commitment to my major. After taking
                   this class I've realized that there is so much I can do to help people by using
                   a STEM degree, and I've realized how important honors classes are to me. Even
                   the courses I'm not thrilled about going into end up having something important
                   to offer. Moving forward I'm pretty sure that I will stay in Computer Science,
                   but I'm searching now for an application that makes a positive impact
                   and I know I can find one. This search has particularly transferred over into
                   what CS electives I'm taking and what internships I have been applying to. Below
                   is my final paper for the class, which I took a lot of interest in writing as
                   this class has made me discover how important social justice is to me.

                <p>
                  This class was really pivotal for me since it reignited my passion for the fine
                   arts. This was the first course in college where I was pushed to be purely
                   creative and make a complete product from my own creativity. I was very proud
                   of my final project and am very happy to share it here as both a component of
                   the class exhibition and a standalone piece. This class also inspired me to
                   register next quarter for the Intro Sculpture class where I'm excited to
                   explore new mediums.
