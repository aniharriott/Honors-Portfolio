                <h3>Visa Internship</h3>
                <h4>Experience in industry</h4>
                <h5>Summer 2020</h5>
                <p>
                    During summer of 2020 I worked at Visa as a Software Test Engineer intern,
                     however as the program was redesigned and moved virtually I worked as a general
                     Software intern with other interns around the world. I worked on two main
                     projects over the course of the internship, and I learned a lot about working
                     in a virtual environment, the importance of communication, and developing my
                     leadership and self-sufficiency. In addition I developing my programming
                     skills, specifically in the ethical hacking realm. The two projects I worked
                     on included a white paper and a cyber security challenge.
                </p>
                <div>
                    <h4>White Paper</h4>
                    <p>
                        The first project I worked on was very different from anything I had done
                         in my courses, and focused more on the business side of the company. I was
                         part of team of interns from all across the U.S. that was tasked with
                         developing and presenting a new solution to help Visa accelerate the world
                         into a cashless society. The solution that my team and I came up with was
                         called VHub and is outlined in the white paper attached. Our goal was to
                         bring the benefits of a digital wallet to the unbanked using existing
                         technologies.

                        This project taught me a lot of new skills as it wasn't focused at all on
                         the programming. I learned a good deal about communication, particularly
                         the amount of planning that is required when dealing with different time
                         zones, and it feels especially important now to have prompt and clear
                         communication when we are all so physically different. I also learned about
                         the payment industry as a lot of background research was necessary to create
                         an effective and implementable idea. One of the most important things I
                         learned was that when developing a new tech solution for a company its
                         preferable to try to combine existing systems in new ways, as this is the
                         most cost effective and implementable. This white paper project also gave
                         me a chance to work on and develop my technical writing skills and make my
                         writing more concise with the limited page count we had. The portion of
                         the paper that I contributed to the most was the Competitor section, as
                         well as a good portion of the statistics.

                    <h4>Cyber Security</h4>
                    <p>
                        The second project I worked on was a cyber security challenge that I did
                         with one other intern. This was very interesting to me because I had never
                         done any kind of cyber security or ethical hacking so there was a lot to
                         learn. In this project a partner and I first worked on the software WebGoat
                         where we learned some hacking skills, and then we were given five days to
                         hack a website that Visa developed for that purpose. Over the course of
                         the five days my partner and I found and exploited vulnerabilities in the
                         site through things like injection and broken authentication. Hacking
                         is still very new to me, but after this challenge I'm interested in
                         learning more and potentially taking a course on cybersecurity at UW. Not
                         only did I learn a great deal about the different methods behind hacking,
                         I also learned a lot about the patience and persistence required to fully
                         check a website for vulnerabilities.

                <p>
                    I was so excited to take this class since it was my first opportunity to have
                     formal learning in the design aspects of computer science. I was surprised that
                     this class din't have any programming portion, but I enjoyed learning a lot
                     about the user perspective and learning good design practices. Referenced
                     is my final project poster.

                    This course was also very helpful in directing my post-graduation plans.
                     Coming off of the past few quarters online, and since I hadn't taken a course
                     with programming in it since the Spring, I was feeling very disconnected from
                     CS as a career. Taking this course which was very programming focused reminded
                     me how much I do enjoy programming and reaffirmed that CS is something I want
                     to do when I graduate. Included is a snippet of code from the Pacman assignment.

                <p>
                    This was a very exciting course for me because it was my first hands on
                     experience coding user-interfaces from scratch. This course allowed me to
                     explore what a front-end development route might look like and confirmed for
                     me that I want to take my post-graduation plans in that direction. I've
                     included a screenshot of the first creative project we did with just basic
                     html/css.

                    I absolutely loved this course and was very excited to take it. The course
                    continued to open my eyes to all the possible applications of CS, and I was
                    very excited and interested to learn about another way I could use my skills
                    in a more visual/design oriented way. I've included a link to my final project.
